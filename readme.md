# üõ°Ô∏è Secure Login System with SQL/XSS Injection Detection (ML-Powered)

This project demonstrates a **secure user login and registration system** with built-in protection against **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** using machine learning models.

It mimics a real-world backend system (like FastAPI) while running entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook** using **Gradio** for a frontend-like interface.

## üîç Features

* ‚úÖ User registration with real-time input sanitization
* ‚úÖ User login validation with hashed password storage
* üö® Detects SQL Injection attempts (e.g., `' OR 1=1`)
* üö® Detects XSS attacks (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`)
* üîê In-memory database simulation
* ‚ö° Powered by machine learning models (`.pkl`) trained on malicious input patterns
* üñ•Ô∏è Gradio-based UI simulating frontend-backend interaction

## üß† Technologies Used

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend UI | Gradio (Python) |
| Backend Logic | Python (simulates FastAPI) |
| ML Detection | Scikit-learn models (`.pkl`) |
| Database (Demo) | In-memory dictionary |
| Notebook | Jupyter / Google Colab |

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### üü¢ Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

No setup needed. Just open the notebook and run all cells.

1. Upload the following files to your Colab session:
   - `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
   - `SQLi_Detection_Model.pkl`
   - `xss_vectorizer.pkl`
   - `XSS_Detection_Model.pkl`

2. Run the `Secure_Login_Demo.ipynb` notebook

3. A Gradio link will appear ‚Äî click to interact with your login/register UI

### üñ•Ô∏è Option 2: Local Machine

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-login-ml.git
cd secure-login-ml
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the notebook or run the Gradio script:
```bash
jupyter notebook Secure_Login_Demo.ipynb
```

## üìã Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following dependencies:

```
gradio>=3.40.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0
joblib>=1.3.0
hashlib
```

## üß™ Sample Inputs

| Test Type | Sample Input | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Normal Login | `john / password123` | ‚úÖ Login Successful |
| SQL Injection | `' OR 1=1 -- / anything` | üö® SQL Injection Detected |
| XSS Attack | `<script>alert(1)</script>` | üö® XSS Attack Detected |
| Malformed | `"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` | üö® XSS Attack Detected |

## üîê Security Features

### SQL Injection Detection
- Trained ML model identifies common SQL injection patterns
- Detects attempts like `' OR 1=1 --`, `UNION SELECT`, etc.
- Real-time validation during login/registration

### XSS Protection
- Machine learning-based XSS attack detection
- Identifies malicious scripts, event handlers, and HTML injection
- Prevents `<script>`, `onclick`, `onerror` attacks

### Password Security
- SHA-256 hashing for password storage
- No plain text passwords in memory
- Secure validation process

## üõ† How It Works

1. **User Input**: Username/password entered via Gradio interface
2. **ML Detection**: Input passed through trained models for threat detection
3. **Sanitization**: Clean inputs processed for authentication
4. **Database Check**: Credentials validated against in-memory user store
5. **Response**: Success/failure with security warnings if needed

## üîê Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a demonstration project for educational purposes.

* Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before storing
* SQLi and XSS attacks are detected using ML models trained on malicious patterns
* In-memory database used only for demonstration (not production ready)
* Real-world deployment should use:
  - Secure database with proper ORM
  - HTTPS encryption
  - Input sanitization libraries
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - Rate limiting and session management

## üõ† Future Improvements

- [ ] Connect with real FastAPI + SQLite backend
- [ ] Add email-based registration & OTP verification
- [ ] Export login/detection logs to CSV
- [ ] Build admin dashboard to manage users
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA
- [ ] Add JWT token authentication
- [ ] Include CSRF protection
- [ ] Add password strength validation

## üß™ Testing the System

### Valid Login Test
```
Username: testuser
Password: mypassword123
Expected: ‚úÖ Login successful
```

### SQL Injection Test
```
Username: admin' OR '1'='1
Password: anything
Expected: üö® SQL Injection attempt detected
```

### XSS Test
```
Username: <script>alert("XSS")</script>
Password: test
Expected: üö® XSS attack detected
```

## üìä Model Performance

The ML models are trained on datasets containing:
- **SQL Injection**: 10,000+ malicious SQL patterns
- **XSS Detection**: 8,000+ cross-site scripting examples
- **False Positive Rate**: < 2%
- **Detection Accuracy**: > 95%
